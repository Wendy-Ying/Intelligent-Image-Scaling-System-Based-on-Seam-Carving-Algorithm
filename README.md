# Intelligent Image Scaling System Based on Seam-Carving Algorithm

Our course project produced an intelligent image scaling system based on seam-carving algorithm. It is able to add and remove pixels for similar regions in an image based on user input to achieve elegant image scaling. It also supports the user to select regions of interest and regions of disinterest to customize the image scaling.

In the project, I was responsible for writing and testing all the code for the GUI, collaborating on module communication between front-end and back-end functions, and writing reports.

## contributors
The project was a joint effort by Yijia Wang, Jingjun Xu, and me.
